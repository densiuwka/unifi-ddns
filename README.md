A Cloudflare Worker script that enables UniFi devices (e.g., UDM-Pro, USG) to dynamically update DNS A/AAAA records on Cloudflare.

## Why Use This?

UniFi devices do not natively support Cloudflare as a DDNS provider. This script bridges that gap, allowing your UniFi device to keep your DNS records updated with your public IP address.

## üöÄ **Setup Overview**

### 1. **Deploy the Cloudflare Worker**

#### **Option 1: Click to Deploy**
[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/willswire/unifi-ddns)

1. Click the button above.
2. Complete the deployment.
3. Note the `*.workers.dev` route.

#### **Option 2: Deploy with Wrangler CLI**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).
3. Run:
   ```sh
   npm i
   wrangler login
   wrangler deploy
   ```
4. Note the `*.workers.dev` route.

### 2. **Generate a Cloudflare API Token**

1. Go to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Navigate to **Profile > API Tokens**
3. Create a token using the **Edit zone DNS** template.
4. Scope the token to **one** specific zone.
5. Save the token securely.

### 3. **Configure UniFi OS**

1. Log in to your [UniFi OS Controller](https://unifi.ui.com/).
2. Go to **Settings > Internet > WAN > Dynamic DNS**.
3. Create New Dynamic DNS with the following information:
   - **Service:** `custom`
   - **Hostname:** `subdomain.example.com` or `example.com`
   - **Username:** Cloudflare Account Email Address (e.g., `you@example.com`)
   - **Password:** Cloudflare User API Token *(not an Account API Token)*
   - **Server:** `<worker-name>.<worker-subdomain>.workers.dev/update?ip=%i&hostname=%h`
     *(Omit `https://`)*

## üõ†Ô∏è **Testing & Troubleshooting**

Using this script with various Ubiquiti devices and different UniFi software versions can introduce unique challenges. If you encounter issues, start by checking the FAQ in `/docs/faq.md`. If you don‚Äôt find a solution, you can ask a question on the [discussions page](https://github.com/willswire/unifi-ddns/discussions/new?category=q-a). If the problem persists, please raise an issue [here](https://github.com/willswire/unifi-ddns/issues).


#### Complementary Notes ~ by 51av0sh
I ran into a few issues and took me about a week to troubleshoot and fix them all. Since documentation is limited I wanted to offer my experience in case someone has similar problems.

1. Starting with installation. I was getting an error when running the Deploy Workers script. I found out that the GHA was not running from the forked repo. To force the run all I did was edit he deploy.yml file (added a space and then removed it). That triggered the workflow and it installed the worker in CF.

2. I have a UDM SE and had to remove the https:// from the server field as it was not working

3. I have a wildcard DNS entry and a root domain entry. To update both at he same time you can add a list of comma separated domains to the Host field like domain.com,*.domain.com. Make sure you have no spaces

4. Some said that dyndns is missing from the UDM but it's there for me in my UDM SE running network application 8.0.28. According to some, if you are missing dyndns you can use dyn. Have not confirmed this.

5. If you want to test this script you have a few options:
   - Ask your ISP for a new IP.
   - Change the modem mac. You might need to contact your ISP to register the modem again.
   - Use inadyn (easiest but needs SSH). [See Here](https://github.com/workerforce/unifi-ddns/issues/42#issuecomment-1790029386)

6. Proxied DNS works fine with this
